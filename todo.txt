x Tourney controller

- Better players list
  - Add a new 'in latest tourney' flag to users
  - Update players sets this if existing player
  - Creating a tourney does this.
- Show all rounds scores instead of just overall and today?
  - Maybe accordion to that?
- Refactor get_round_score_for_today, it breaks on Monday/Tuesday


- Add Hashie to gemfile if we use it.
- Only show players with picks for tourney
- Where is Kuch?
- Update pars to use tourney par
- Don't break on day before
- Desktop design needs some work
