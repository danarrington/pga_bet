- Tourney controller
  - What's the current tournament?
  - Create as tourney?
    - Do some math on if it looks like the most recent picks are 'old'
  - Show all rounds scores instead of just overall and today?
    - Maybe accordion to that?
- Refactor get_round_score_for_today, it breaks on Monday/Tuesday


- Only show players with picks for tourney
- Where is Kuch?
- Update pars to use tourney par
- Don't break on day before
- Desktop design needs some work
